Nowadays, maintenance strategies have progressed from breakdown maintenance to preventive maintenance, then to condition-based maintenance (CBM). Breakdown maintenance is the common way of maintenance, where no actions are taken to maintain the equipment until it breaks, data processing, and decision making. There are two words in Literature commonly confused Diagnosis and prognosis are the two important aspects in a CBM system. Diagnosis is the ability to detect fault in the present, isolate and identify which component is failure, and decide on the potential impact of failed component on the health of the system. Fault detection is a task to indicate whether something is going wrong in the monitored system; fault isolation is a task to locate the component that is faulty; and fault identification is a task to determine the nature of the fault when it is detected. Prognosis is the capability to use available observations to predict upcoming states of machine or forecast the fault before it occurs, it is seeing to the past, the actual state, to predict fault possibilities\cite{van2009machine}.
